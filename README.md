Slight modification to @vicwomg's original to utilize yt-dlp over youtube-dl to bypass the download speed limitation imposed by Youtube.

I didn't make any changes to switch youtube-dl to use yt-dlp so you still need to download yt-dlp:

pip3 install --upgrade yt-dlp

then when launching app.py use launch with switch:
-v /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
