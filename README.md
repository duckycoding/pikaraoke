# PiKaraoke

PiKaraoke with a minor personal tweak.

# Changes
- Minor change to accomodate using yt-dlp over youtube-dl for faster downloading purposes
- Moved the 'Include non-karaoke matches' out of the advance menu

# How-to
Given that these are minor changes you'll still download yt-dlp to get things going.

pip3 install --upgrade yt-dlp

then when launching app.py use launch with switch:
-y /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp

# Bugs
- Updating yt-dlp doesn't work using the menu (for obvious reasons)
